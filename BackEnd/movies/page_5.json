He has no job and hardly any friends. One night Kôichi meets Ryota at a bar which is also a sex club. Ryota came to Berlin to visit a German guy whom he had \"met\" on a dating app. His high hopes for romance (and marriage?) were quickly crushed since the German was only interested in sex, not even letting Ryota stay for the night. That is why Ryota ended up spending the night in the dark room of the sex club. Kôichi for some reason lets Ryota stay at his apartment. They have sex. Ryota goes out almost everyday to get laid by various local men and comes home to Kôichi's. Increasingly caught up with a strange feeling that is akin to but not quite frustration or curiosity (needless to say, it is not even close to love), Kôichi gradually gives himself up to sex with Ryota.","popularity":366.841,"poster_path":"/aH0yHU915NibzznpB2Zks2c6Z9O.jpg","release_date":"2017-09-10","title":"Berlin Drifters","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":14},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/fOy2Jurz9k6RnJnMUMRDAgBwru2.jpg","genre_ids":[16,10751,35,14],"id":508947,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Turning Red","overview":"Thirteen-year-old Mei is experiencing the awkwardness of being a teenager with a twist – when she gets too excited, she transforms into a giant red panda.","popularity":315.454,"poster_path":"/qsdjk9oAKSQMWs0Vt5Pyfh6O4GZ.jpg","release_date":"2022-03-10","title":"Turning Red","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":3873},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/8YFL5QQVPy3AgrEQxNYVSgiPEbe.jpg","genre_ids":[12,878,35],"id":640146,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania","overview":"Super-Hero partners Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne, along with with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, find themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible.","popularity":313.276,"poster_path":"/ngl2FKBlU4fhbdsrtdom9LVLBXw.jpg","release_date":"2023-02-10","title":"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":21},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/i6zyJ18xvVvqbN6eUdzgSwlhb8h.jpg","genre_ids":[9648,80,27],"id":800815,"original_language":"en","original_title":"The Pale Blue Eye","overview":"West Point, New York, 1830.
